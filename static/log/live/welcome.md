# what is this? where am i?

This is a platform for me to journal and document ideas, research, opinions, reviews, and more. 

I've found that writing out my thoughts helps the world feel more real, as it forces me to sit with the words and feelings more meaningfully.

I've been needing an avenue to deep-dive or over-explain things i'd like to talk about without spamming someone's DMs, and this seems like the best medium.

Should help me from doomscrolling too. Times are weird rn.

To commemorate the year and month that I started this project. Below is my most played song of 2025 according to my Spotify Wrapped:

# inspirations & credit 

## i. styling
the fonts and colors are inspired by two main things:

the cover art to Thee Sacred Souls's 2021 single [When I See You Again](https://theesacredsouls.bandcamp.com/album/will-i-see-you-again): 

![When I See You Again](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3932023307_16.jpg)

and a lot of what monte booker has going circa 2025. specifically, some of his obs setup for his [twitch streams](https://www.twitch.tv/montebooker):

![monte stream](https://three2semicolon.github.io/log/static/visuals/img/inspo_montestream.PNG)

*my bad for the mid-sentence screenshot, monte*

the font for the title is [Madie Roger](https://blogfonts.com/madie-roger.font) (headers too if i remember to code that). rest of the site uses [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk) as its main font. there's a bit of processing done on the header to get that "drip" psychedelic effect, see the sites [GitHub](https://github.com/three2semicolon/log/) for more info there

# tech stack

GitHub for the nerds: [github.com/three2semicolon/log](https://github.com/three2semicolon/log/)

This site is built to be "static", in the sense that there is no server (node, react, flask, etc) running constantly to host the site. Every page you view is a static html file at load time, as this site was originally built for GitHub page hosting.

I write all my blogs in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as .md files. I run a small js script (either manually or triggered via a GitHub push) that will generate the .html for each post. These are the pages you view (like the one you're on now).
