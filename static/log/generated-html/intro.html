            <h1>what is this? where am i?</h1>
<p>this is a platform for me to journal and document ideas, research, opinions, reviews, and more.</p>
<p>i&#39;ve found that writing out my thoughts helps the world feel more real, as it forces me to sit with the words and feelings more meaningfully.</p>
<p>been needing an avenue to deep-dive or over-explain things i&#39;d like to talk about without spamming someone&#39;s DMs, and this seems like the best medium.</p>
<p>should help me from doomscrolling too. times are weird rn.</p>
<hr>
<p>to commemorate the year and month that I started this project. Below is my most played song of 2025 according to my Spotify Wrapped:</p>

<h1>inspirations &amp; credit</h1>
<h2>i. styling</h2>
<p>the fonts and colors are inspired by two main things:</p>
<p>the cover art to Thee Sacred Souls&#39;s 2021 single <a href="https://theesacredsouls.bandcamp.com/album/will-i-see-you-again">When I See You Again</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3932023307_16.jpg" alt="When I See You Again"></p>
<p>and a lot of what monte booker has going circa 2025. specifically, some of his obs setup for his <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/montebooker">twitch streams</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://three2semicolon.github.io/log/static/visuals/img/inspo_montestream.PNG" alt="monte stream"></p>
<p><em>my bad for the mid-sentence screenshot, monte</em></p>
<p>the font for the title is <a href="https://blogfonts.com/madie-roger.font">Madie Roger</a> (headers too if i remember to code that). rest of the site uses <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Grotesk">Space Grotesk</a> as its main font. there&#39;s a bit of processing done on the header to get that &quot;drip&quot; psychedelic effect, see the sites <a href="https://github.com/three2semicolon/log/">GitHub</a> for more info there</p>

<h1>tech stack</h1>
<p>GitHub for the nerds: <a href="https://github.com/three2semicolon/log/">github.com/three2semicolon/log</a></p>
<p>this site is built to be &quot;static&quot;, in the sense that there is no server (node, react, flask, etc) running constantly to host the site. every page you view is a static html file at load time, as this site was originally built for GitHub page hosting.</p>
<p>u write all my blogs in <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> as .md files. I run a small js script (either manually or triggered via a GitHub push) that will generate the .html for each post. these are the pages you view (like the one you&#39;re on now).</p>
<hr>
<h1>rolling todo / feature list for me to implement soon</h1>
<ul>
<li>RSS subscriptions</li>
<li>substack integration - i want these posts to also go on substack when it makes sense. might automate, prob won&#39;t. im lazy</li>
<li>update about me with socials, esp github (also thanks manashield)</li>
<li>future categories (visualists, recipes(?), ))</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1>wrap up</h1>
<p>thanks for checking out the site, hope something on here resonates or interests you. don&#39;t hesitate to hit me up or follow me elsewhere via the <a href="https://three2semicolon.github.io/log/?p=about">about page</a></p>
