            <h3><em>in search of</em></h3>
<p><em>this is the first post in a series i&#39;m calling &quot;in search of&quot;, where i discuss different paths i take in the search of finding new art/things (usually new music)</em></p>
<p><em>one way i love to discover new artists/albums is through the credits of some of my favorite albums and songs. i tend to get stuck in rabbit holes, thank you <a href="https://www.discogs.com/">Discogs</a>.</em> 
<em>(music via production credits )</em></p>
<p><em>we can think of each album as its own pocket universe of musicians, producers, engineers, feelings, and inspirations to get lost in. in this volume i&#39;ll be exploring one of my favorite universes:</em></p>

<em>PORTRAIT OF DANIELA by Yi-Shuan Lee 李奕諠 , 2019 - from his <a href="https://www.yishuanlee.com/tamale">collection of orginal artwork for this album</a></em></p>
<p><em>Tamale</em> is a 2019 EP by singer, songwriter, and producer Daniela Andrade. this project is a very personal, very silky/smooth, and at times very psychadelic r&amp;b journey.</p>
<p><em>december 9th, 2020</em> i started a rolling collab Spotify playlist w/ a few of my friends to easily share new finds around the friend group. the second song ever added to that playlist was <strong>Ayayai</strong>, the second single off of <em>Tamale</em>. forever in debt to my friend Micah for that.</p>

*buy it on [bandcamp](https://danielaandrade.bandcamp.com/album/tamale) too* 


<p>Andrade is an undeniable singing talent, and has production credits on every song too. no listed features on the EP either, but like most musical projects this one is very much still a collaborative effort. in the following sections i&#39;ll be briefly discussing a few of these collaborators and the music i found through them (both made by them or made by other collaborators of those collaborators. we&#39;re hitting many degrees of separation here).</p>
<p>i&#39;ll try to make a playlist for each one of these writeups containing some of the music i ran into. see the one for tamale here, feel free to listen along as you read forward: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1S5gIJsR9VMBONRbcrt1C7?si=fa10bd43f5714784&pt=b9461842d3f993631812714c1cfde76f">spotify, sorry</a></p>

<h1>sean matsukawa</h1>
<p>starting from the top, the trap-infused downtempo title track <em>Tamale</em> features production from Sean Matsukawa and Ashton McCreight</p>
<p>Sean seems to primarily label himself as an artist, producer, and mixing/mastering engineer. he&#39;s got some <a href="https://engineears.com/seanmatsukawa?selectedTab=portfolio">pretty crazy credits</a> under his belt. Kendrick Lamar, SZA, Steve Lacy, ROSALÍA, Vince Staples, and more. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.voyagela.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/personal_photo-90-937x600.jpeg" alt="sean matsukawa"></p>
<p>luther, third track off of Kendrick&#39;s <em>gnx</em> <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/sean-matsukawa/61346">just caught a Grammy nomination</a>. he&#39;s got engineer credits on that joint, so i might have to update this to denote him as a Grammy winner within the next week. he&#39;s got a few engineer credits on SZA most recent output <em>LANA</em> too.</p>
<p>outside of engineering, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/seanmatsukawa">Matsukawa</a> is very much an artist of his own. multi-instrumentalist, performer, producer, singer. he&#39;s put a lot of dope music out into the world. </p>
<p>one of my favorites from his solo work is a 2020 song titled <em>ANYWAY.</em></p>

*his songs all have incredible artwork btw. many seem to made by or in collaboration with [Ben Clement](https://www.instagram.com/_benclement/?hl=en).

<p>next person on my list, Ashton mccreight, has production credits on this song as well. cool stuff.</p>
<h1>ashton mccreight</h1>
<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ashtonbeats">Ashton McCreight</a>is a producer/beat maker through and through. His soundcloud is full of beat tapes, flips, loose beats, etc.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A1121490517&color=%23ae7263&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false&visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/ashtonbeats" title="Ashton McCreight" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Ashton McCreight</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ashtonbeats/prioritize" title="Prioritize" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Prioritize</a></div>


<p>him and Sean teamed up again for the production on track 5 of <em>Tamale</em>, <em>$$$</em>, another favorite of mine of the project. </p>
<p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ashton-mccreight/songs">lots and lots of production credits</a> from lots and lots of artists under this dude&#39;s belt. one of my favorites from my search though is from a song with Cletus Strap titled <em>Point Of No Return</em>. </p>
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2xuGuy4qcGUrRqjoS771lH?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>seem to be frequent collaborators, Cletus is dope.</p>
<p>check his site out, he&#39;s got beat packs and a <a href="https://ashtonmccreight.com/pages/freebeats">free beat subscription</a> for anyone dying to hop on an Ashton beat. his tapes are all great too. </p>
<p><em>&quot;aye, good lookin ashton&quot;</em></p>
<h1>young clancy</h1>
<p>the aforementioned song <em>Ayayai</em> off of <em>Tamale</em> has a couple listed collaborators: Young Clancy and Gray Rowan</p>
<p>Young Clancy, listed formally as Nate Burley on spotify, self describes his work as &quot;rough pillowy music&quot;. couldn&#39;t agree more. both his production and singing are very lush, with a gruff edge.</p>
<p>his 2021 <em>SOMETHING SOMETHING TAPE</em> is super cool. vocal features on pretty much every track here, including a very relevant appearance from Daniela Andrade on GRIM REAP.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/soundcloud%253Aplaylists%253A1134157186&color=%23363736&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=false&visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/young-clancy" title="YOUNG CLANCY" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">YOUNG CLANCY</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/young-clancy/sets/something-demos-mixes-masters" title="SOMETHING SOMETHING TAPE" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">SOMETHING SOMETHING TAPE</a></div>

<p>wanted to close this section with a quote. <a href="https://whenthehornblows.com/content/2019/3/3/introducing-0076-young-clancy">When The Horn Blows interviewed Clancy</a> in 2019, asking him what his favorite thing about Toronto is. </p>
<p>his answer was simply:
<strong>&quot;Pascal Siakam.&quot;</strong></p>

<h1>gray rowan</h1>
<p>Gray Rowan&#39;s all over Daniela Andrade&#39;s discography, with production creds on 3 song from <em>Tamale</em> (<em>Fin</em>, <em>Wet Dreams</em>, and <em>Ayayai</em>. very frequent collaborator</p>
<p>his name kept coming up throughout my search. he&#39;s produced/collaborated with Young Clancy on his solo work, Daniela Andrade on her other projects, and has credits for many <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/3845280-Gray-Rowan?srsltid=AfmBOoovPNuvrF8_3ri-AKR_1KD5zZWEYzNIeYwkR7mPI0D7n7-lKUhZ">many other artists/songs</a>. i&#39;ll talk about a few in the following subsections.</p>
<p>as of writing this section (its jan 23rd, 2026), Andrade&#39;s single <em>i see red</em> has been out for 2 days. i&#39;ve had this song on repeat, very representative of what drew me into <em>Tamale</em> when i first heard it.</p>
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3Gg7L1NuNNhqltvDgd6VHI?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>first listed production credit is, of course, Rowan.</p>
<h2>a l l i e</h2>
<p>going through Rowan&#39;s credits an album immediately jumped out at me (as i had heard it before). a l l i e&#39;s <em>Tabula Rasa</em>, a beautiful project from 2021, also has Rowan&#39;s fingerprints all over it</p>
<p>wanted to briefly highlight another a l l i e song from the same album, titled &quot;[DNA](<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/38o7Zj6s8-4?si=Gu2K4UGM2pgwA0pJ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>)&quot;, featuring Daniela Andrade herself. love this song, one of my most played songs on spotify (all time)</p>
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2pynCI5GBvS41YlbkA7Yhh?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe> 

<p>this song was produced by the topic of the next section, Dan Only, who seems to work with Gray Rowan often.</p>
<h2>dan only</h2>
<p>Dan Only was another name that came up constantly throughout my search, despite Dan Only having no credits on Tamale. </p>
<p>he co-produces often with Gray Rowan, notably appearing with on the a l l i e album and Young Clancy&#39;s work (both discussed previously).</p>
<p>lots of solo work and production creds with other artists to explore here as well, a lot electronic/house leaning music.</p>
<p>a couple favorites from the search:</p>
<p>Gateway Shuffle - Dan Only</p>
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2ugSgWSP3cKkQX5ksu5ObI?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## jonah yano

<p>an even looser connection, but one i wanted to highlight.</p>
<p>Gray Rowan is listed to have mastered the 2023 album <em>Portrait Of A Dog</em>, by Jonah Yano. </p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=4178993182/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=ffffff/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://jonahyano.bandcamp.com/album/portrait-of-a-dog">portrait of a dog by Jonah Yano</a></iframe>

<p>I didn&#39;t gather too much info on Yano, but listened through this album and his 2024 album titled <em>Jonah Yano &amp; The Heavy Loop</em>. both great projects. </p>
<p>the latter has a song <em>Snowpath</em> featuring the legendary Clairo. </p>
<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2676846603/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1485947972/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://jonahyano.bandcamp.com/album/jonah-yano-the-heavy-loop">Jonah Yano &amp; The Heavy Loop by Jonah Yano</a></iframe>

<p>i note this, specifically, because in building this blogsite i heavily considering my first <em>in search of</em> to be about Clairo and El Michels Affair. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ccottrill/sets/charm?si=788e7357dfe8496db901c00091ceab7d&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">Charm</a> is a very special once in a lifetime kind of album. i&#39;ll write about it another day.</p>
<h2>duncan hood</h2>
<p>Duncan Hood is responsible for the drums on the live renditions of Andrade&#39;s <em>Ayayai</em> and <em>Wet Dreams</em> (both from <em>Tamale</em>) from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvUgsZPKVOc">this performance</a>:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvUgsZPKVOc?si=Dau7UUyEIfi5Zwck" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
from there i explored some of his other work (stalked his [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/duncanfhood/?hl=en)), lots of drum and production contributions. [he contributed to Andrade's *cohete*](https://www.instagram.com/p/DP6zAfKke-_/?hl=en), a single off of her 2026 project (to be released)

<p>to highlight a couple artists found through his network that will be in my rotation:</p>
<p>j ember, via his 2025 album <em>Beauty Supply</em></p>
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6tp7E4t5wMJ4LWQF3g6YJb?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<p>and Ouri, via her 2025 album <em>Daisy Cutter</em>. her duo work with Helena Deland under the name <em>Hildegard</em> will def be on my radar from now on too.</p>
<iframe data-testid="embed-iframe" style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4qAqkkxrFe0V8jIKoI83o4?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

<h1>closing notes</h1>
<p><em>Tamale</em> is a masterpiece, i love this project. the soundscape Andrade and her collaborators built captured me immediately and has yet to let go. i&#39;m happy to have found so many artists and songs equally as capturing through my search. it&#39;s been a great journey through the <em>Tamale</em> universe.</p>
<p>she&#39;s dropping an album this year (2026) called &quot;<strong>Oda</strong>&quot;, very excited for that. a few singles out already and they&#39;re all <strong>really</strong> really good (mentioned &quot;i see red&quot; earlier). look out for it.</p>

<p><em>P.S. if someone can find palimpsest by charlotte day wilson. the project came up in my search and i haven&#39;t been able to find a version available anywhere. gray rowan mastered it, and then her name came up again via her collab with Ouri</em>  </p>
